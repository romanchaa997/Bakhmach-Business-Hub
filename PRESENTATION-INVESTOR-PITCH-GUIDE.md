## PRESENTATION DECK OUTLINE (10 Slides)

### Slide 1: Title & Vision
**Headline**: "Bakhmach Business Hub: Integrated Platform for Holistic Optimization"
**Tagline**: Building the Platform Cooperative where Code, AI, and Consciousness Evolve Together
**Visual**: 5-layer architecture diagram animated
**Speaker Notes**: We're solving the fragmentation crisis - developers today use 5+ disconnected platforms for optimization, ML, production, growth, and research.

### Slide 2: The Problem - Fragmentation
**Problem**: Modern teams manage:
- Code optimization tools (separate)
- ML infrastructure platforms (separate)
- Production monitoring (separate)
- Personal development apps (separate)
- Research platforms (separate)

**Impact**: No unified visibility, context switching, redundant overhead
**Market Insight**: Developers spend 30% time on tool switching, not solving problems

### Slide 3: Our Solution
**The Bakhmach Advantage**:
1. **Unified Architecture** - 5 dimensions integrated, single API
2. **Platform Cooperative Model** - Users own 30%, transparent governance
3. **Open Source Core** - GPLv3, community-driven development
